Own idea of Second Assignment on Mobile Programming Devices on CIT

# Goal
This second assignment I developed an educational solution for discovering and getting another approach to the 
chemical elements. It is intended for teachers and kids around 8 years old. The app allows to a teacher, 
to search and register new items such as chemical elements or any other useful stuff that is presented on Wikipedia.
Using the public Wikipedia REST API, I retrieve the data queried by the teacherâ€™s input and I show it in an user-friendly 
interface. Then with the help of a QR code generator and a proper format of the text using JSON notation, the teacher can 
print them for being discovered by the children. On the children UI, we can see a big floating button which allows them to
scan a QR code, and then view the details on a list of discovered elements.
